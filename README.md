Ruby Maze Solving and Creation

This program will load a string of 0's and 1's and store it as a maze;
the 0's represent empty spaces and the 1's represent walls.

It can also generate r x c mazes, where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns, using the Maze#redesign method.

To get an print-out of how to solve a maze, use the trace method on a Maze object.

For an example of all the main functions of this program, look at code_test.rb. You can run this with the command "ruby code_test.rb" 

Further documentation (generated by rdoc) can be found in the doc folder.
